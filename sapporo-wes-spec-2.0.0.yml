            \ where this field is missing, for example, so that a missing field does\
            \ not accidentally imply that the state is QUEUED.\n\n  + QUEUED: The\
            \ task is queued.\n\n  + INITIALIZING: The task has been assigned to a\
            \ worker and is currently preparing to run. For example, the worker may\
            \ be turning on, downloading input files, etc.\n\n  + RUNNING: The task\
            \ is running. Input files are downloaded and the first Executor has been\
            \ started.\n\n  + PAUSED: The task is paused. An implementation may have\
            \ the ability to pause a task, but this is not required.\n\n  + COMPLETE:\
            \ The task has completed running. Executors have exited without error\n\
            \  and output files have been successfully uploaded.\n\n  + EXECUTOR_ERROR:\
            \ The task encountered an error in one of the Executor processes. Generally,\n\
            this means that an Executor exited with a non-zero exit code.\n\n  + SYSTEM_ERROR:\
            \ The task was stopped due to a system error, but not from an Executor,\n\
            for example an upload failed due to network issues, the worker's ran out\
            \ of disk space, etc.\n\n  + CANCELED: The task was canceled by the user.\n\
            \n  + CANCELING: The task was canceled by the user, and is in the process\
            \ of stopping.\n\n  + PREEMPTED: The task is stopped (preempted) by the\
            \ system. The reasons for this would be tied to\nthe specific system running\
            \ the job. Generally, this means that the system reclaimed the compute\
            \ capacity for reallocation.\n"

    way.*


    ## Executive Summary


    he Workflow Execution Service (WES) API provides a standard way for users to submit
    workflow requests to workflow execution systems and monitor their execution. This
    API lets users run a single workflow (currently [**CWL**](https://www.commonwl.org/)
    or [**WDL**](http://www.openwdl.org/) formatted workflows, with other types potentially
    supported in the future) on multiple different platforms, clouds, and environments.


    Key features of the API:


    - Request that a workflow be run.

    - Pass parameters to that workflow (e.g., input files, command-line arguments).

    - Get information about running workflows (e.g., status, errors, output file locations).

    - Cancel a running workflow.


    ## Sapporo-WES Extensions


    `sapporo-wes-2.0.0` extends the original WES API to provide enhanced functionality
    and support for additional features. This document describes the WES API and details
    the specific endpoints, request formats, and responses, aimed at developers of
    WES-compatible services and clients.

      description: 'This endpoint creates a new workflow run and returns a `RunId`
        to monitor its progress.

        The `workflow_attachment` array may be used to upload files that are required
        to execute the workflow, including the primary workflow, tools imported by
        the workflow, other files referenced by the workflow, or files which are part
        of the input.  The implementation should stage these files to a temporary
        directory and execute the workflow from there. These parts must have a Content-Disposition
        header with a "filename" provided for each part.  Filenames may include subdirectories,
        but must not include references to parent directories with ''..'' -- implementations
        should guard against maliciously constructed filenames.

        The `workflow_url` is either an absolute URL to a workflow file that is accessible
        by the WES endpoint, or a relative URL corresponding to one of the files attached
        using `workflow_attachment`.

        The `workflow_params` JSON object specifies input parameters, such as input
        files.  The exact format of the JSON object depends on the conventions of
        the workflow language being used.  Input files should either be absolute URLs,
        or relative URLs corresponding to files uploaded using `workflow_attachment`.  The
        WES endpoint must understand and be able to access URLs supplied in the input.  This
        is implementation specific.

        The `workflow_type` is the type of workflow language and must be "CWL" or
        "WDL" currently (or another alternative  supported by this WES instance).

        The `workflow_type_version` is the version of the workflow language submitted
        and must be one supported by this WES instance.

        The `workflow_engine` is the engine that supports the workflow_type and must
        be supported by this WES instance.

        The `workflow_engine_version` is the version of workflow engine and must be
